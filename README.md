**A script to make a backup of https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc site. It's a popular book by AlSweigart. 
We often face problems when internet is not available. So made a script to make a offline copy of the whole site(Atleast the main chapters + content)**

**##Only extra package you may need to install is bs4(BeautifulSoup). Rest are already within the standard library**

*Just run the run.py file to start the backup process*
